    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grounded beef:</strong> use 90-95% lean ground beef for this recipe. You don’t want the filling to be excessively greasy!</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger and garlic:</strong> You can also use a combination of ginger and garlic paste, just use double the amount if the ingredients are combined. You could also grate fresh ginger and garlic if you’d prefer to use that instead</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> You’ll need a few different spices for this recipe: kosher salt, Indian chili powder, red pepper flakes, garam masala, and turmeric. Keep in mind that Indian chili powder is a little different than cayenne. If you use cayenne, you’ll want to start with 1/2 teaspoon and adjust as desired.</li>
        <li><strong>onions:</strong> The chopped onions go in towards the end once the protein is cooked. These add lots of crunch and flavor to the samosas! </li>
        <li><strong>Cilantro:</strong> Some parts of the world call this coriander leaves. These go intowards the end with the chopped onions. If you aren’t a fan, I suggest using less, but once the samosas are fried, I personally can’t single out the flavor of cilantro! You can omit it if you’d like though.</li>
        <li><strong>Serrano pepper:</strong> Add freshness and a tiny kick. Remove the seeds and ribs before mincing these finally, so all you get is the pepper flavor without too much heat!</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon Juice:</strong> use freshly squeezed for this recipe to make sure that it gives the samosa the best flavor. The acid in the lemons also helps cut the spice a bit!</li>
        <li><strong>Spring roll sheets:</strong> You could also use samosa wrappers</li>
        <li><strong>Egg white:</strong> a beaten egg white is used as an egg wash that we brush on the samosa wrappers before folding. This just ensures that the samosas stay wrapped and don’t pop open! </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start the Filling:</strong> Add the ground beef to a saute pan over medium-high heat. Cook and crumble the meat for 1minute then add 1 cup of water and continue to break down the ground beef with a wooden spoon as you let it boil. You want the ground beef to cook in the water for 5-6 minutes and for it to no longer be raw. Drain the beef in a sieve, but don’t let it sit in the sieve for too long. You want some of the water to still be in the beef</li>
        <li><strong>Saute the Filling:</strong> Immediately add the ground beef to the same skillet and season with salt, chili powder, red pepper flakes, garam masala, turmeric, ginger and garlic paste. Stir and toss the meat to evenly coat it in all the seasonings. If the seasonings are adhering to the meat because it’s too dry, you can add another 1-2 tablespoons of water to help the filling and seasonings come together. Allow this to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix it:</strong> Once the beef filling has cooled, stir in the chopped onions, cilantro, and serrano peppers. Add the lemon juice and stir to combine. Once the filling is ready, we’ll fold them up and fry them!</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap it up:</strong> Once you fill the pocket you’ve created with the ground beef, you’ll use the egg wash to help stick the ends of the wrapper to the triangle you’ve created. Some people use a flour and water slurry to stick the wrapper down, the egg white is easier though, in my opinion!</li>
        <li><strong>Frying:</strong> Heat a few inches of oil in a frying pan (or sauce pan) over medium heat or heat your deep fryer according to manufacturers directions. When the oil is hot, gently place a few samosas and fry them.When the oil is hot, gently place a few samosas and fry them. They take roughly 5-8 minutes to turn golden brown. Then remove them to a plate with paper towels to dry up any excess oil and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
